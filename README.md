# Boris Bikes Challenges

London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

The body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
